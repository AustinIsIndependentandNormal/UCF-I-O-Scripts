With the popularity of programs like R and Python increases researchers are starting to build their own personal library of scripts 
for data cleaning, management, and analysis in the same way they build a library of research articles. 
The purpose of this repository is to pool these scripts on a program wide level. 

******************************This project relies on collaboration to be successful******************************

Please upload any scripts you have that could potentially help other students.
This can be done by either:
  - Submitting a new pull request (make sure the script is added to the appropriate subfolder)
  - E-mailing Austin Carter at Austin.Carter@knights.ucf.edu (please include the appropriate subfolder location in the e-mail)

1. All submitted scripts should be stripped of any collected data, participant personal identifiable information, or anything else that will get you thrown into IRB jail.

2. All scripts in this repository are free to use without attribution unless specifically notated. However, in order to keep the project going if you make any modifications to the scripts that change it's functionality please upload the new script either as a pull request or by emailing Austin.Carter@knights.ucf.edu

3. Be careful what you upload! Though I don't believe anyone in the program would try to scoop an idea from someone, this repository is publicly viewable. Ensure that your script does not give away enough information to allow someone to steal your research idea.

4. Please strive to follow best coding practices. Comments should be included frequently to make your script understandable. A well commented script should allow someone naive to your research to use your script for their own research without needing to ask you for an explanation. Good coding practices can be found here https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/top-15-best-practices-for-writing-super-readable-code--net-8118
  -In my opinion the most important characteristics of well written code are thorough commenting and meaningful variable names (e.g.,      use "conscientousness" rather than "x")

Issues/questions specific to scripts already in the repository should be submitted using github's issues feature located near the top of the page

General issues/questions or issues/questions relating to not yet uploaded scripts can be directed to Austin.Carter@knights.ucf.edu

All feedback/suggestions can be directed to Austin.Carter@knights.ucf.edu. He is very sensitive though so try to work in some compliments to any complaint.
